### 1. Why need format

It will benefit ourselves and others.

### 2. Specific format

Let's first see the abstract formula:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

example:
```
fix(controller) : nullpointexception
```

#### type

It is used to explain the type of this `commit` and can only be in the following 7 types:

- feat：add new function（feature）of your project.
- fix：fix bugs.
- docs：add documentation.
- style： just modify the style of code,it does'n affect the execution of code.
- refactor：neither feat nor fix,it may affect the execution of code.
- test：add test unit.
- chore：change of build tools or helper and enviroment.

#### scope

It is used to explain the scope of this `commit`,such as `view layer,model layer,controller layer` and so on.

#### subject

It is a short description of this `commit` and it can not be in excess of 50 character.

- start with verb and use first persion present tense,such as change instead of changes nor changed
- make sure the first character should be lower case
- do not add period(.) at the end of your `subject`

As you see,above tips of `subject` also follow it's rules.

- - -
THE END.
